# Lecture 02: Understanding JSX in React

## Overview

In this lecture, we delved into JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML but allows you to write UI elements directly in JavaScript. It plays a crucial role in how we build and structure components in React.

## Key Concepts of JSX

### 1. What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It lets us write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, making it easier to create React components. Even though it looks like HTML, JSX is actually JavaScript under the hood.

Example of JSX:

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

```

This line of code looks like HTML but is converted by React into JavaScript that the browser can understand. 

## Key Points About JSX

### 1. Embedding JavaScript in JSX

You can insert JavaScript values, variables, or functions directly into JSX using curly braces {}.

For example:

```
const name = "Ankita";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;

```

In this case, the {name} will be replaced with the value of the name variable, which is "Ankita", so it will display Hello, Ankita!.

### 2. JSX Needs One Parent Element

JSX elements must be wrapped in a single parent element. If you have multiple elements, they must all be inside one parent, like a div or a fragment (<> </>).

Example:

```
// Correct way
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);

```

Alternatively, you can use a fragment to avoid extra div tags:

```
return (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </>
);

```

### 3. JSX Attributes

JSX uses attributes similar to HTML, but with some differences:

- class becomes className in JSX.
- for becomes htmlFor.
  
Example:

```
const element = <div className="header">This is a header</div>;

```

#### Self-Closing Tags:

Some elements like <img /> and <input /> donâ€™t need closing tags, so you can write them as self-closing:

```
const element = <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample" />;

```

### 4. JSX is Safe

JSX automatically escapes any JavaScript or HTML code you put inside it. This means it protects your app from dangerous code (like scripts) that could harm your site.

Example:

```
const userInput = "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>";
const element = <div>{userInput}</div>;  // React shows it as text, not as code.

```

### 5. Styling with JSX

To add styles directly in JSX, you use an object where the style names are written in camelCase. For example, background-color becomes backgroundColor.

Example:

```
const styleObject = {
  color: 'blue',
  backgroundColor: 'lightgray'
};

const element = <div style={styleObject}>Styled Text</div>;

```

## Key Takeaways

- JSX allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, making it easier to build UI elements.
- We can insert JavaScript code inside JSX using curly braces {}.
- Every JSX element needs a parent element.
- JSX escapes harmful code, making your app safe from attacks.
- Attributes are similar to HTML, but some like class and for need to be changed to className and htmlFor.

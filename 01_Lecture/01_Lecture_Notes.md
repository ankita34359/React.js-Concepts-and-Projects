# Lecture 01: Introduction to React Js & Installation

## Key Concepts Covered:

### 1. What is React?
- React is a JavaScript library primarily used for building user interfaces (UIs), especially for single-page applications (SPAs).
- Developed and maintained by Facebook, it allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.
- The core principle of React is component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable components that can manage their own state.

### Key Features:
- Component-Based: UIs in React are built from small, isolated pieces of code called components, making it easier to manage and reuse code.
- Virtual DOM: React uses an in-memory representation of the real DOM (Document Object Model). This makes rendering fast by only updating the changed parts of the DOM instead of re-rendering the entire page.

# Lecture 04: Understanding Basic Website Functionality, SPA vs. MPA, Node Modules and Bootstrap

## Overview

In this lecture, I covered how a basic website works, learned the key differences between Single-Page Applications (SPA) and Multi-Page Applications (MPA), explored Node Modules in React projects, and took a glimpse into Bootstrap for styling React apps.

## üåê How a Basic Website Works

A website is essentially a collection of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) served by a server and displayed on a browser. Here‚Äôs a basic flow:

Client (Browser): The user sends a request (e.g., by entering a URL).
Server: The server processes the request and sends the appropriate files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).
Rendering: The browser renders the HTML, applies the CSS for styling, and runs JavaScript for interactivity.
This basic flow forms the backbone of web applications, whether simple websites or more advanced web apps.
